# SuperIntW64  

Made to prove a point, not to solve a problem.

## Features
- [x] Addition  
- [x] Subtraction  
- [x] Multiplication  
- [ ] Division  
  
- [x] Greater than (>)  
- [x] Less than (<)  
- [x] Equal to (==)  

## Open Problems
### [supermath.cpp](https://github.com/Bocksa/SuperIntW64/blob/main/supermath.cpp)
supermath::Random(superint* usiMin, superint* usiMax) does not generate a random number between the minimum and maximum efficiently and can take a long time with potential infinite yields.
